👋 Hi, I’m @JT-Kim89  
I’m an Ocean Engineer with a strong interest in Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT).
Recently, I’ve been working on automating OpenFAST simulations using Python to streamline the process of file generation, simulation execution, and post-processing the results. 
This includes evaluating the strength of mooring lines and analyzing fatigue damage based on DNV standards.

I also hold a Big Data Analysis Engineer certification, which I obtained in South Korea in July 2024. 
The certification includes practical evaluations in Python-based data analysis (using Pandas), statistics (using SciPy.stats), and machine learning (using Scikit-learn).

👀 I’m interested in
- Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT)
- Wind energy engineering and simulation tools
- Mooring systems and structural integrity analysis 
- Data analysis and machine learning for engineering applications

🌱 I’m currently learning
- Python (for automation and simulation)
- OpenFAST and other simulation platforms (Bladed, OrcaFlex, ...)
- C# (to develop optimization tools for FPSO dimensions)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Projects related to floating wind turbines, renewable energy, or offshore engineering
- Tools for optimizing offshore structures (FPSO, FOWT, etc.)
- Data analysis and machine learning for offshore and renewable energy systems
- Anyone interested in automating engineering simulations or working with OpenFAST
